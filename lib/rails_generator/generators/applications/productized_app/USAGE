Description:
    The 'rails_product' command creates a new Productized Rails Application
    with a default directory structure and configuration at the path you
    specify.

Example:
    rails_product ~/Code/Ruby/cart

    This generates a skeletal Productized Rails installation in
      ~/Code/Ruby/cart
    
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
